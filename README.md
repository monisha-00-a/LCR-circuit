# LCR Circuit

An **LCR circuit** (or **RLC circuit**) is an electrical circuit consisting of three passive components:
 L – Inductor
 C – Capacitor
 R – Resistor
These components can be connected in either **series** or **parallel**, forming circuits widely used in analog electronics and communication systems.
**Series LCR circuit:** All components connected in series
**Parallel LCR circuit:** Components connected in parallel


 # Working Principle:

In an AC-powered LCR circuit, the voltage and current vary sinusoidally over time. Each component reacts differently to the alternating signal:
 **Resistor (R):** Opposes current flow with a constant resistance, dissipating energy as heat.
 **Inductor (L):** Stores energy in a magnetic field and opposes changes in current. 
 **Capacitor (C):** Stores energy in an electric field and opposes changes in voltage. 



 # Applications of LCR Circuits

1.**Tuned circuits** in radios and TV sets
2.**Oscillators** and signal generators
3.**Band-pass** and **band-stop filters**
4.**Power factor correction** in AC systems
5.**Sensor circuits** and automatic gain control
